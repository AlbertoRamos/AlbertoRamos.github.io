<p> I work with computational mathematics, mostly with nonlinear optimization.
Some topics of my interest:
<ul>
  <li> Unconstrained minimization methods; </li>
  <li> Boxed constrained minimization; </li>
  <li> Julia language; </li>
  <li> Comparing optimization methods. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Some projects I'm working:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/optimizers/CUTEst.jl"> CUTEst.jl </a>
    - A Julia language interface for the CUTEst repository. </li>
</ul>
