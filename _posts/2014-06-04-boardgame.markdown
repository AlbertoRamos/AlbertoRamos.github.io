<p> I (not so) recently became interested in board games. To clarify, I am not
talking about the "classic" board games like War, Monopoly, and such.
I'm talking about board games with advanced mechanics. This does not mean they are
all complex, but that they are (mostly) well-though and balanced.
These board games gathered a legion of followers, most of them geeks and nerds,
that are interested in some fun hobby. Note that RPG and digital games are
normally part of these hobbies.

<p> One of the great things about board games is the great range of complexity
and seriousness that they cover. You can play a 10-15 minute game with extremely
simple rules (such as Fluxx), or an intense, no-luck, hours long war game (such
as Diplomacy). One my favorite games so far is Battlestar Galactica, a game
based on the homonymous series.
