# LaTeX (bibtex) Substitute

LaTeX is great, and won't be going anywhere anytime soon.
We are dependent on it, and it has too many good things to consider abandoning
it now.
However, there are some problems with it.
For instance, there isn't a way to handle bibliography that will work on every
computer every time, for everyone and every template, class, etc.

## A Simpler way

One possibility of change is something like Markdown.
Some configuration files and bibtex files, then the content in markdown with
LaTeX input through special characters.

The trick now is to create a tool that converts this to a usable, readable,
efficient tex file, so that it can be submitted to journals, for instance.

## LaTeX 3

Another possibility is the update to LaTeX 3, which I know nothing about, but
it is being developed for some time now.
How long until it is complete? How good it is? Does it solve the problems?
