# BibTex Network

When working with LaTeX documents, a way to facilitate the management of
references is to use BibTex, because it is reusable, and leaves the styling of
the references to someone else.
However, writing the BibTex is also error prone, so we have to be careful about
it.
A way to solve this is to use a bibliography management software, but I want
something more.

I propose the creation of a system to manage the bibliography with a revision
system, online, distributed, with CLI and GUI tools to access it.

## TODO

Nothing is done for this project. I started something like this more than a
year ago called [bibcli](https://github.com/abelsiqueira/bibcli), but I want to
do things differently.

  - Propose the system completely (front- and back-end);
  - Implement the back-end;
  - Implement back-ends.

## Requirements

  - The system has to be open, distributed and portable;
  - An easy interface has to be available, maybe even online;
  - An API has to be available.

## Target audience

  - If you are a software developer, this is for you.
  - If you are a librarian, this is for you.
  - If you use BibTex a lot, this is for you.
  - If you want something very challenging, that will probably take years to
    complete, this is for you.
  - If you don't like conflict, this is **not** for you.
