# Optimization Fractals

One the most well-known fractals is the Newton Fractal, obtained from using the
Newton method for nonlinear equations to the complex function
$$ f(z) = z^3 - 1,$$
and plotting the complex plane according to the point it converges to.
If you consider a specific function, you may obtain the same fractal from the
Newton method for optimization.

I propose the investigate this property further, including other methods and
functions.
