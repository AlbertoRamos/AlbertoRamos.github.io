# CUTEst.jl

[CUTEst.jl](https://github.com/optimizers/CUTEst.jl) is a Julia interface for
the CUTEst repository.
This interface provides many ways to access the CUTEst functions, allowing a
work-now-improve-later workflow for nonlinear optimization.

## TODO

Me and [Dominique Orban](https://www.gerad.ca/~orban/) are actively developing
this, so things here can be outdated. Visit the github repository for more
updated information.

  - Release stable version;
  - Installable version without having to previously download CUTEst;
  - Documentation;
  - Workshop material.

## Target audience

  - If you like to program, this is for you.
  - If you are an applied mathematician, specially from the nonlinear
    optimization field, this is for you.
