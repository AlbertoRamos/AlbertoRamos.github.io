I work with computational mathematics, mostly with nonlinear optimization.
Some topics of my interest:

  - Unconstrained minimization methods;
  - Boxed constrained minimization;
  - Julia language;
  - Comparing optimization methods.

Some projects I'm working:

  - [CUTEsj.jl](https://github.com/optimizers/CUTEst.jl):
    A Julia language interface for the CUTEst repository.
